<article style=""><h1>Me and Dad - Rick and Joan's Place</h1><p>Couple of weeks ago I took the week off to do projects around the house. Wound up between two main objectives so I chose the one that produced the most visible results and required operating equipment... We wound up with two full sized pick up truck loads to go up the mountain.</p><img src="http://www.one-earth.community/rickandjoan/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/08/image21.jpg" /></article>
