  What may I ask is wrong with the high school, other then it wasn't built to
  last forever like M-town and S-town elementary schools. The hard earned tax
  dollars we unquestionably hand off to elected officials NEED to go to the
  educational tools of the students! PERHAPS if the citizens of the ELCO School
  District send a message to the board by WITHHOLDING real estate tax payments
  until a public consensus sets a logical spending direction. WE the people have

  that message ! Do you think there is enough room in the county jail to house
  all of the ELCO taxpayers ? Not likely. Calm and calculated is the approach
  the citizens need to take to FINALLY say enough is enough ! Fill the
  auditorium or if need be use that big beautiful stadium to gather to start
  sending a message that is long overdue !What may I ask is wrong with the high
