No surprise you find nothing but political name calling and celebrity breakups. So I flip the screen on the phone and tap the photos icon and the smiles begin. Birds and fish. Sunsets and sunrises. But most of all smiling faces of family young and old from get togethers or simple text messages.Have a great Friday \uD83D\uDE0A"

Sitting here with my orange juice taking a moment before heading out to work. I find myself reading through emails finding nothing but junk.

No surprise you find nothing but political name calling and celebrity breakups. So I flip the screen on the phone and tap the photos icon and the smiles begin. Birds and fish. Sunsets and sunrises.
