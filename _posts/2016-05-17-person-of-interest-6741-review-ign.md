description: "So that was Shaw's big return! Wow! What a spectacular chapter. Of course, by return I mean to the show, not to the team, as this was a dark, subversive, heartbreaking story. I'm not sure how many of you were able to get out ahead of this one, what with the virtual reality twist and all, but either way it was really superbly executed."
