# Weekend Wrap Up

May 31,2016

It was a wonderful holiday weekend with one exception...Joan had to work Monday.

A Saturday picnic in Chester County so we caught up with the family to the south. 😃

A Sunday of lawn mowing and some pond maintenance...how exciting 😁

Monday...Joan working and me exploring the food store 😎 running the sweeper 😁 and exploring the grid 👽

We closed out the holiday with a supper time gathering at mom and dad's. The northing contingent of the family. 

Son Dan dropped in and wants to do airborne training...
